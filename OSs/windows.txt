file structure:
~($home)
  windows default folders:
  - \Documents (local)
    - programs throw their user-facing files here (and their non-user-facing data in AppData)
      - so, should create your own main folder in $home dir
  - \OneDrive (cloud, 5tb free)
    - documents
    - desktop
    - pictures
  - 'My Documents\Pictures\Videos\etc.' (shortcuts to ~\Documents\[My ...])
  - \Saved Games
  - ...some more crap by windows (Searches??, Favorites??, etc.)

  - ...a ton of other crap added by other programs:
  - .hidden-app-folders

  my custom folders:
  - \stuff
    - \repos



my stuff vs stuff vs _my-stuff vs -my-stuff
  x/- \my-stuff (conflicts name with the old 'My ...' shortcuts)
    - this was my original folder in linux/mac/dropbox
    - 'my-' is enough for terminal to guess it
  x/- \_my-stuff has _ and -
  x/- \-my-stuff will work well in terminals and folder priority over the other crap...
    - update: nope! doesn't work with windows, as it looks like a command-line flag
  - \stuff
    - simple, good, works in terminals, just the folder priority in gui`s suck


file and folder naming conventions:
stick to 'names with spaces' and let terminal do it's magic
  - feels good to be back to spaces :)

this-might-suck for windows's built-in search functions


package managers:
winget
  - added to windows 10 sometime
  - installs to system, requires admin rights
chocolatey
  - community-organized
  - installs to system, requires admin rights
scoop
  - doesn't use msi installers which mess with the registry
  - thus oriented toward portable apps
  - installs to ~/scoop/, sounds similar to snap

note: there's also windows sandbox to install stuff in temporarily

conclusion:
scoop for sandboxing/trying apps?
winget for essentials to be integrated into windows, allowing windows to backup your settings
chocolatey for others apps not on winget/windows store
