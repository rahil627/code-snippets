todo:
include the 'programming' folder from 'my notes' folder
  - create another git repo in programming(?), and use a git submodule here
    - not sure if its a good idea to have a repo inside of another repo...
  - if not, then just add a link to the readme to my notes/computers/programming


rename 'my-stuff' to stuff, 'my notes' to notes, 'n so on
  - this makes it nice for cli auto-completion, although, with current shells, it'll auto-complete as you type the word regardless of the my!
  - its also nice to have a single naming convention, as of now, i think its 'photos', 'documents', along with 'my notes'

# my programming-related stuff
includes:
 - notes
 - code editor configs
 - OS configs
   - server ("dot files")
     - Fedora
       - if not, OpenSUSE tumbleweed
   - personal
     - Windows (dual-boot)
     - ArchLinux (VM vs WSL2)
     - Mac OS X (dual-boot)
 - scripts
   - every-day use
