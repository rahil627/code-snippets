todo:
include the 'programming' folder from 'my notes' folder
  - create another git repo in programming(?), and use a git submodule here
    - not sure if its a good idea to have a repo inside of another repo...
  - if not, then just add a link to the readme to my notes/computers/programming


rename 'my-stuff' to stuff, 'my notes' to notes, 'n so on
  - this makes it nice for cli
  - its also nice to have a single naming convention, as of now, i think its 'photos', 'documents', along with 'my notes'

# my programming-related stuff
includes:  
 - code editor themes, fonts, configs
 - server configs ("dot files")
 - scripts

i found some from my first job... wowww
