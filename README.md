todo:
include the 'programming' folder from 'my notes' folder
  - create another git repo in programming(?), and use a git submodule here
    - not sure if its a good idea to have a repo inside of another repo...
  - if not, then just add a link to the readme to my notes/computers/programming

# my programming-related stuff
includes:  
 - code editor themes, fonts
 - vim configs, etc.
 - code snippets
 - server configs ("dot files")
 - shell scripts
