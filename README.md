todo:
include the 'programming' folder from 'my notes' folder
  - create another git repo in programming(?), and use a git submodule here
    - not sure if its a good idea to have a repo inside of another repo...
  - if not, then just add a link to the readme to my notes/computers/programming


rename 'my-stuff' to stuff, 'my notes' to notes, 'n so on
  - this makes it nice for cli auto-completion, although, with current shells, it'll auto-complete as you type the word regardless of the my!
  - its also nice to have a single naming convention, as of now, i think its 'photos', 'documents', along with 'my notes'

 - notes
 - code editor configs

   - server
     - OpenSUSE tumbleed or leap (dotfiles or nix)
