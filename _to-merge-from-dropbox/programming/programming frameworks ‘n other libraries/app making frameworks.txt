cross-platform frameworks:
Flutter

Avalonia
Uno
Xamarin

wxWidgets

React (Native)
Ionic

notes:
1. Flutter
  - dart, Google’s new stuff
  - hot-reload
  - supports native widgets and web
  - mobile as main target, but works on everything!
  - renders/draws using Skia graphics lib
  - most loved framework on the SO survey

2. Avalonia
  - renders widgets with Skia (like Flutter)
  - uses one of the C#/.NET WinForms-like api to build widgets
  - more desktop-oriented
  - "cleanest" code-base
  
2. Uno
  - renders widgets using the platform's primitives
  - uses one of the C#/.NET WinForms-like api to build widgets
  - hot re-load
  - more mobile-oriented

3. wxWidgets
  - a very old but solid open-source C++ project
  - **mobile support is pretty non-existant**
  - there are many bindings for it, including one for haxe! HaxeUI contains it as a build option!!
    - http://haxeui.org/getting-started/hello-world/
      - pretty sick, just change build target and bam! but surely mobile support is lacking. :(

3. Maui <- Xamarin
  - .net / c# world, uses native ui
  - two ways to do ui: forms library can be used for completely code-shared ui, or, ios and android specific libraries can be accessed making for more complex platform-specific ui
  - there is only ‘fast deployment’ for android devices via android studio; there is no live-reloading
  - old-school build ‘n deploy process
  - **of the big 3 (Flutter, Xamarin, React), this was the least loved**

3. React
  - javascript world, a web framework, but also has a native framework (React Native)
  - most popular, therefore many libraries, tutorials, support
  - live-reload (no need to build, deploy, etc.)
  - completely code shared, ‘build once, run everywhere’
  - you sorta build "components" (widgets) with HTML syntax (ew)
  - made by Facebook? (*vomit*)
  - as of 2022, still the most popular

x/Ionic
  - typescript, angular, uses cordova (aka phonegap) to port web code to devices, uses web (html, css) for ui
  - because it uses web for ui, it just can’t look good as native ui apps
  - can now be used with any javascript front-end (react, angular, vue, etc.)?




# my answer to a reddit question:
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/sqk6id/avalonia_vs_uno_vs_maui_vs_flutter/

tldr: try Avalonia or Uno so that you can stick to C#, then, if they end up being problematic, fallback to Flutter. Maui, well... i was never a fan of Xamarin, but i’m glad they changed that horrible name!

i was just looking at this too... maybe there’s some C# bindings for wxWidgets? I found one for my language: haxe via haxeui lib... It just seems like one of those old solid libs that’ll never die, like many good C++ libs... This way, you don’t have to learn a whole ‘nother api, framework, way of doing, language, or anything! :)

although... now looking at the repo... i just don’t see much mobile support... even the iOS readme says it’s just for “a base for simple apps”... :(

poop.

... yeahhhhh, it might be better to go for the newer stuff (Avalonia, Uno, Maui) or solid stuff (Google’s Flutter)...

i found this, to help choose which one:

though, do note, written in june 2021, and now Avalonia might have decent mobile too? (still in beta)
