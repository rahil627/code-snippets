smaller, non-giant corporate server companies:
these are nicer, quaint, more for indie devs (whereas the giant companies feel like for enterprise use only)

Digital Ocean
Linode
Vultr
...
many other smaller ones



free servers?:
these are usually just a crap virtual machine

Google Compute Engine

from my discord message:
as it turns out, the free "e2-micro" google compute machine is limited, *very limited*:
> When you use E2 shared-core machine types, your VM runs two vCPUs simultaneously shared on one physical core for a specific fraction of time depending on the machine type. Each vCPU can burst up to 100% of CPU time, for short periods, before returning to the time limitations described in the preceding section.
> ...
> e2-micro sustains 2 vCPUs, each for 12.5% of CPU time totaling 25% vCPU time.

server service for apps:
many of the corporate giants have free service for PaaS apps sort of stuff:
Google Firebase
Oracle
Amazon (...maybe?)
etc.
