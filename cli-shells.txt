  - a good straight-foward tech post abuot the history of shells
  
basically:
sh = bourne shell
  - the main precursor and origin to/of the most popular future shells
bash = bourne again shell
  - most prevalent, used on all desktop Linux-derived OSs, including Mac OS X
  - history: was created by open-source people GNU while they were creatin their free OS
ash = Almaquish shell
  - a light-wieght sub-set of bash used in embeded systems
  - you can find it on the tiny Linux distros installed on mobile devices, sch as ArchLinux, which itself uses BusyBox
    - i personally have "iSH" app on my iOS device, and this thing is lightning fast!!!, this is actually where i played with and learned vi: because it was *so* much faster than using CLI with my server
zsh = z? shell
  - a super-set of bash, used on contemporary desktop systems
  - Mac OS X recently replaced bash with this
  - more features, more configurability, etc.
  
  
others:
csh, tcsh, one other one = c shell, improved c shell, ane one other one
  - C-like shell with more scripting ability than the bourne shell? A bit dated now..?
fish
  - a beginner-friendly shell with highlighting for errors, spell-checking, etc., although, because it's different from bash, it might not really be so useful..?
