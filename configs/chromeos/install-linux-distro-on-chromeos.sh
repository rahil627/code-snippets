  - Sommelier - Nested Wayland compositor with support for X11 forwarding
  - Sommelier is an implementation of a Wayland compositor that delegates compositing to a ‘host’ compositor. Sommelier includes a set of features that allows it to run inside a tight jail or virtual machine.
  - Sommelier can run as service or as a wrapper around the execution of a program. As a service, called the parent sommelier, it spawns new processes as needed to service clients.
