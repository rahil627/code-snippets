file structure:
.config
  - config files of various apps

# shell-specific
/base16-shell-themes/
  - i think used in combo with nvim base16 themes, which provides a big selection of themes
.config/fish/config.fish
.config/fish/functions/
  - most are generated by alias commands
.aliases.fish
  - i might've made this up? run it to gen functions
.bashrc
.inputrc
  - affects all app that use readline (including bash command-line)
  - feels cleaner to keep my configs here, and leave .bashrc generated
.zhrc

others:
.ctags.d/
  - currently for haxe ctags which maybe have been used in conjunction with nvim to create a class navigator panel for nvim
