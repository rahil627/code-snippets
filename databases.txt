relational vs "nosql"
relational are the traditional spreadsheet-like column 'n rows
nosql can have various forms, but generally meant for less related data

relational db's:
**postgres**
  - the standard
**sqllite**
  - if you have never touched databases before you may want to start with SQLite so you don't have to worry about setting up a database, connecting to it, and deploying it. Everything you do in SQLite is available in Postgres, but not the opposite way around.
