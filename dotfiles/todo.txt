nvim tabs vs spaces
  - i changed it to use spaces instead of tabs, will python still work?

bindings dotfile?
  - check what fzf_fish plug-in binds, then create own bindings
    - fzf_configure_bindings --help
  - control+lower-case-only, alt+anything
  - bind function keys for stuff too?
  - c+a+r = reverse search, c+a+f = search directory with preview, a+c cd "widget", c+t find file "widget"
  - should make it:
  - c+f = search file without preview
  - c+a+f = search file with preview
  - c+c, c+h, c+r = reverse search command history
  - c+d = directory explorer / navigator

test changing terminal colors via iOS app, otherwise delete base16 themes?

delete ctags stuff?
  - including plugins related to it
