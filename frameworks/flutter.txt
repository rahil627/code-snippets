in vscode can type '>Flutter' to show flutter commands
'>Flutter select device'
  - or click the platform device on the bottom right status bar
  - if it doesn't work, just run it via cli (flutter run -d device-name)

# test flutter setup
flutter doctor

# show connected "devices" (platforms)
flutter devices

# runs --debug by default, provides debug tools
flutter run -d chrome
# --web-renderer html or --web-renderer canvaskit

# release takes longer to compile
# once compiled though, you're good, then can hot reload
flutter run -d chrome --release

# web-server without browser
flutter run -d web-server
# note: it's hidden by default
# flutter devices --show-web-server-device

  - 500mb just for the required dependencies "core dev tools"
    - maybe installed a different version of llvm than crystal?

must install chrome in the linux conatainer for web dev
otherwise, can do native app dev, without Android Studio?



vs code:
just get Flutter extension
which auto-installs the Dart extension
https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/vs-code

process:
create a github repo with 'gh repo create'
run command: flutter create application
move the files to the repo folder
run command: select device (or click the device on the bottom status bar)
flutter pub get
  - vs code should ask you about fetching dependencies
run w/o debug
profit?
