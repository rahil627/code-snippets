live reload?:
a reddit comment by me:
hmmm, after a bit more research, it seems all the major engines have it:
unreal
- "live coding" basically deprecates "hot reload" in v4.22
godot
- "synchronize script changes" (GDscript & C#)
unity
- free/open-source plugin
- paid plugin
game-maker
- GMLive paid plugin ;(

i'm guessing it's done language level, so any C# scripting should be able to do this feature...

heck, even haxe/heaps has this feature! :)

but i agree, it's a killer feature.

  - basically me when i was lookin' at engines in 2022



https://www.reddit.com/r/monogame/comments/14dsvf3/what_other_frameworks_have_you_tried/
> Other frameworks and engines are nice but they usually fall into two categories, either they have so many features and are so complex that you almost get forced into doing things their way, (Unity, Unreal, Godot) or they are so barebones that the work involved in making the foundation level things to make a game with them would be just as much as making a game in Monogame in the first place.
