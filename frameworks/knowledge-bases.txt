formats:

plain text files
  - my own personal notes' format
  - can write a simple markup for it to preview it
  - easy to sift through with linux commands

**jekyll**
  - a static-site generator written in ruby and used by github for github programmers
    - i use this for my personal sites (plural!), especially for my blog/philosophical writings
    - tons of plugins
      - also can just write beautiful ruby scripts to do whatever you want
    - allows you to create your own custom markup template, so you can keep your own personal writing format
  + front-matter
  + folder 'n file structure

obsidian
  - current king of note-taking
  - closed-source
  - great interface
    - like a specialized vs-code, with an intuitive command pallete
  - diagram-making thing
  - graph view
  - views for outline by headings, tags, backlinks, etc.
  - bookmarks
    - seems useful!
  - **no front-matter/metadata by default**, just clean ol' plain text!
    - **maybe can use this when i want to, without destroying my notes structure**

joplin
  - open-source obsidian?
  - works on all platforms, and has a good linux cli  
  - simple, takes a few seconds to get started
  - "notebooks" and tags
  - strange tracking metadata by default??
    - latitude: 37.91613260
    - longitude: -122.31076500
    - altitude: 0.0000
  - simple tags metadata:
    - tags:
    - test
    - test2

**dendron**
  + front-matter
  + **a specific file 'n file-name structure**:
    - parent.parent.file
      - no folders!
      - this is actually a neat solution
      - will be interesting to sift through without a dendron editor (vs code), yet might rid the need of searching through folders!
      - all hierarchies are files, no need for folders!
  - a vscode plugin, no standalone app
    - although, this may just be the best app for programmers that use vs code..
    - also can just edit using your favorite simple text editors and cli

bear
  - more of a markdown editor turned note-taking app
  - great markup/preview, especially for mobile OSs

x/notion
  - historically, a great push for note-taking apps
  - a very clean note-taking app with tons of markup ability
  - **need internet to access!?**
  - slow for a notes taking app

  onenote, evernote, etc.
    - old propietary note file format?
