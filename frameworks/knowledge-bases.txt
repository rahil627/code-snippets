formats:

**plain text files**
  - **my own personal notes' format**
  - **TODO: can write a simple markup for it to preview it**
  - **easy to sift through with cli**

**jekyll**
  - note: not a knowledge-base
  - a static-site generator written in ruby and used by github pages
    - i use this for my personal sites (plural!), especially for my blog/philosophical writings
    - tons of plugins
      - also can just write beautiful ruby scripts to do whatever you want
    - allows you to create your own custom markup template, so you can keep your own personal writing format
  + front-matter
    - but also have the option to simply upload an html file (which every knowledge-base app should be able to generate!)
  + folder 'n file structure

bear
  - more of a markdown editor turned note-taking app
  - great markup/preview, especially for mobile OSs
  
x/obsidian
  - current king of note-taking
  - **closed-source**
  - great interface
    - like a specialized vs-code, with an intuitive command pallete
    - feels well-made
    - unfortunately another electron app, so might as well use vs-code/dendron
  - plugins
  - works well on mobile devices
  - diagram-making thing
  - graph view
  - views for outline by headings, tags, backlinks, etc.
  - bookmarks
    - seems useful!

x/joplin
  - poor man's open-source obsidian?
  - works on all platforms, and has a good linux cli
  - simple, takes a few seconds to get started
  - "notebooks" and tags
  - strange tracking metadata by default??
    - latitude: 37.91613260
    - longitude: -122.31076500
    - altitude: 0.0000
  - simple tags metadata:
    - tags:
    - test
    - test2

dendron
  - https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9
  + front-matter
  + **a specific file 'n file-name structure**:
    - parent.parent.file
      - **no folders! hierarchies are in the file-name**
      - destroys my dropbox file-folder structure, which i much prefer
      - **TODO: see if there's an option for folders**
  - a vscode plugin, no standalone app
    - although, this may just be the best app for programmers that use vs code..
    - can just edit using your favorite simple text editors, it's just that there's likely built-in functions made for vs-code via the vs-code extension
  - seems well made by a small team, or just one person
  
x/notion
  - historically, a great push for note-taking apps
  - a very clean note-taking app with tons of markup ability
  - **need internet to access!?**
  - *slow* for a note-taking app

onenote, evernote, etc.
  - old propietary note file format?
