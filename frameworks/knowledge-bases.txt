  - my own personal notes' format

  - a static-site generator written in ruby and used by github for github programmers
    - i use this for my personal sites (plural!), especially for my blog/philosophical writings
    - tons of plugins
      - also can just write beautiful ruby scripts to do whatever you want

obsidian
  - current king of note-taking

  - open-source obsidian?
  - works on all platforms, and has a good linux cli  

**dendron**
  + front-matter
  + file 'n file-name structure
    - parent.parent.file
    - no folders
      - makes it a pain to sift through without a dendron editor (vs code)
      - all hierarchies are files, which is strange when you just want a folder..?
  - a vscode plugin, no standalone app
    - although, this may just be the best app for programmers that use vs code..
    - also can just edit using your favorite simple text editors and cli
