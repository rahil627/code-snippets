  only update debian through chromeOS, not through linux!

      - Historically Google has waited until after Debian's first point update has been released to update Crostini, at which point users are given the opportunity via the UI to upgrade existing containers. Also, at this point, new containers are built using the new stable version (i.e. bookworm). For non-technical people this is the safest way to go - just wait the couple of months or so and you'll be prompted.

increase dpi on vs code
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/comments/cesxr0/vscode_ui_and_fonts_too_small_heres_how_to_fix_it/
  - essentially, you modify: /usr/share/applications/code.desktop
  - #replace this line: Exec=/usr/share/code/code --unity-launch %F
  - Exec=sommelier -X --scale=0.8 --dpi=160 /usr/share/code/code "--unity-launch %F"
  - #replace this line: Exec=/usr/share/code/code --new-window %F
  - Exec=sommelier -X --scale=0.8 --dpi=160 /usr/share/code/code "--new-window %F"
  - Smaller value for --scale means more magnification. The fonts actually look sharp.
