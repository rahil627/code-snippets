from previous install:

the minimal desktop thingy

desktop:
should be good for remote desktop apps
xfce

chrome-rdp
  - can try noVNC instead

package managers:
native:
  - checked by the people that maintain the distro
apt
  - debian
dnf
  - fedora

non-native:
  - unchecked, includes all dependencies, making it easier for app-devs to maintain
snap(d)
flatpak

cli:
fish
  - not compliant with POSIX, bash, etc., so bash script may fail
  - comes equipped with the most useful shell tools
zsh
  - for the most part, works well with bash, though still not POSIX compliant
  - comes naked, and will require manually tinkering add-ons over time to get it set-up right

core cli apps:
tldr
  - way better manual than man
fzf
  - holy shit, search entire OS with this!

htop

dropbox
  - cli vs app

dev-related:
nvim
git
gh - github cli

haxelibs

gems (Ruby):

snaps:
code
sublime-text
ruby
  - not sure why it's here..






snap is sandboxed, so use it for temporary apps
