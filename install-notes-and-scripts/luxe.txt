once you accept the github invite I sent (check email), there's this LD jam game, https://github.com/luxeengine/ld46 - https://ruby0x1.itch.io/the-ruins
it's a little platformer with some scenes + some tilemaps if you want to open it in editor and look around some content.
- magical ice cream thing https://luxeengine.com/1.0/k2020/ - https://github.com/luxeengine/icecream 
- breakout game https://joeld42.itch.io/breaklchemy - https://github.com/luxeengine/breaklchemy

the guide is important for big picture, and the tutorial highly recommended as it covers a whole lot, takes a few hours. if you have questions or thoughts definitely please share, here in DM is fine, there's also the private dev chat channels there or you can file issues. nothing is too small etc, all feedback is good
