the default crystal vs code extension doesn't include autocomplete, so:
install crystalline
  - https://github.com/elbywan/crystalline
  - in the default extension's settings, point vscode's lsp to the binary
  - turn on all lsp-related settings: completions, hover, implemenations

pry?

the default installation installs without the interpreter

TODO:
to run crystal -i, you need to re-install crystal with -i flag (interpreter)
