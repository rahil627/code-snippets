# install elixir's hex package manager
mix local.hex

# list all cli tasks

# setup language server (elixir-ls)
## vs code
simply install the extension: elixir-lsp.elixir-ls
NOTE: in order for it to work, by default, you must open the folder where the project was generated, which has a .elixir_ls folder in it

# syntax

# Atoms are constants whose values are their own name. They start with `:`.
:hello # atom
# this. is. great.

# Tuples that are stored contiguously in memory.
{1,2,3} # tuple
elem({1, 2, 3}, 0) #=> 1

# To concatenate lists use `++`, for binaries use `<>`
[1,2,3] ++ [4,5]     #=> [1,2,3,4,5]
'hello ' ++ 'world'  #=> 'hello world'

<<1,2,3>> <> <<4,5>> #=> <<1,2,3,4,5>>
"hello " <> "world"  #=> "hello world"


[1,2,3] # list
[head | tail] = [1,2,3]

# In Elixir, just like in Erlang, the `=` denotes pattern matching and
# not an assignment.
# {a, b, c} = {1, 2} #=> ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {1,2}A

# Ranges are represented as `start..end` (both inclusive)
1..10 #=> 1..10

# Maps are key-value pairs
genders = %{"david" => "male", "gillian" => "female"}
genders["david"] #=> "male"

# Maps with atom keys can be used like this
# NOTE: this is used very very often in phoenix!
genders = %{david: "male", gillian: "female"}
genders.gillian #=> "female"
