notes here are related to solely the language itself

# naming conventions
seems to be case insensitive, which is great as .net uses caps heavily
doesn't like '-', or any special characters except '_' 

# environment vars
$Env:PSModulePath -split (';')

# learn x in y minutes
Invoke-Expression -Command "ls"
$array = @("stuff");
$hash = @{key = "value"}
Export-ModuleMember -Function * -Alias * -Variable *
