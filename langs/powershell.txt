notes here are related to solely the language itself

# naming conventions
seems to be case insensitive, which is great as .net uses caps heavily
doesn't like '-', or any special characters except '_'

# environment vars
$Env:PSModulePath -split (';')
$PROFILE # your powershell's settings go here

# learn x in y minutes
Invoke-Expression -Command "ls"
$array = @("stuff");
$hash = @{key = "value"}

"string substitution is easy as $string $array-value $hash-value"


# put this at the end of a "module" (.psm1)
Export-ModuleMember -Function * -Alias * -Variable *

# check output properties of an object
this-function-outputs-an-object | Get-Member
or-this-way | select

# then select the object's properties/columns you want to output
some-function | select name, definition, description

# properties and values? TODO
or-this | Format-List Property *
