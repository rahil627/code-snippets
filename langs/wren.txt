wren for normal non-embedded scripting?

# conclusion
no. must be embedded to C (or C++?)

because there is no standard library, this is neither suitable for general programs nor even small scripts. Libuv seems nice, but even that is just a minimalist io module, not a standard library replacement. Also, you'd need the user have to download the "wren cli" repo, which itself is rather experimental, maybe even abandoned, which makes it absolutely useless to most users.

you'd have to create a C file, embed wren (and it's vm) into it, then link the C libs you need to wren (several ways provided)
  - see end of https://wren.io/embedding/
  - https://wren.io/embedding/calling-c-from-wren.html

however, for it's purpose, it kicks ass, much prettier in all ways (syntax, concurrency, classes) than Lua for game 'n ui app scripting and for general embedding into C (/C++?), which is what all the game libs are written in. Lua only has a better "run-time": LuaJIT, but as that can't be used for many consoles and iOS, it's no use, and the standard Lua interpreter is actually just as slow or even slower than wren!


# what's included?
System class is bare, basically with just print(), gc(), and clock()

optional modules Meta and Random can be added via compiler flags
  - Meta includes the interpreter and compiler functions

Fiber class is used for concurrency

the rest are just the standard types (strings, etc.)

these are the things that are included in the VM, and nothing more



# cli repl that includes libuv
because there is no standard library, it used libuv for concurrent io

https://github.com/wren-lang/wren-cli
  - test/os/process folder for process class and executing commands
  - test/io folder for file stuff

design patterns:

// string enum
class In {
  static jump { "jump" }
}

// int enum
class GamepadEvent {
    static unknown          { 0 }
    static device_added     { 1 }

        if(value == device_remapped)    return "device_remapped"
        return "unknown %(value)"
    }
}

class Singleton {
  // to avoid circular references
  // and to expose something that often imported
  var random:Random = null // i think it's only needed once..
  static random:Random { random }
}


// remove callback from within a callback function?
var callback = null // ?
...
attach(...) {
    callback = Fn.new {|a, b, s, d|
            handle_collision(a, b, s, d)
              }

                  Arcade.add_collision_callback(e, callback)
                  }
                  ...
                  handle_collision(a, b, s, d) {
                    ...
                     Arcade.remove_collision_callback(entity_a, callback)
                    ...

syntax:

https://wren.io/try/
  - test wren code here
  - otherwise need to download the cli bundle (interpreter + libuv)
    - https://wren.io/cli/
      - TODO: maybe abandoned..?? try it out..


var x = 4
var x:Num = 4 // type is inferred?
// no constants!
// no static vars? see enum design pattern


// no var += 1
// no var++

// string interpolation
Log.print("creating a pebble at `%(pebble.x) , %(pebble.y)`...")

// no top-level functions as in ruby, must be in a class
//  - also you don't import files, you import classes from files

class Hello {
    // **class fields must come first**
    // **and must be initialized**. can use any expression
    var value = 3
    var _field = 4 // TODO: maybe a C# property?

    // constructor
    construct new/create() {}
    object.new/create() // like ruby!
}




// callbacks (passing a funciton as a parameter) must use closures
// example:
class Test{
  static on(fn){
    fn.call("Hello")
  }

  static method(argument){
    System.print(argument)
  }
}

//Test.on(Test.method) // no!
Test.on{|arg| Test.method(arg)} // yes!
callback = Fn.new {|...| ...}
Test.on(callback) // or this


// input is a function, but no ()?
Frame.end { do-something() }

// hmmmm... TODO: try to comprehend some more..
Arcade.add_collision_callback(player) {|entity_a, entity_b, state, normal, overlap_dist|}

## object
// these show up in auto-completion for all objects

Object.same(o, o2) // same as == except it can't be overriden
o == o2 // value-types compared by value, all other types compared by "identity" (reference?)
o.is(o2) // also true if it contains any superclass

o.toString // used often via System.print(o)
