wren for normal non-embedded scripting?
  - no! must be embedded to C (or C++)

# conclusion
because there is no standard library, i dont think this can really be used for neither programs nor even small scripts. Libuv seems nice, but even that is just a minimalist io module. Even a scripting language needs a good standard library. You shouldn't have to rewrite that, nor even select them / build up your own standard library. You will need things like regex, more helpful / end-user-oriented file io and networking, and all those things you'd normal use found in a common standard library.

no is the answer

you'd have to create a C file, embed wren (and it's vm) into it, then link the C libs you need to wren (several ways provided)
  - see end of https://wren.io/embedding/
  - https://wren.io/embedding/calling-c-from-wren.html

however, for it's purpose, it kicks ass, much prettier in all ways (syntax, concurrency, classes) than Lua for game 'n ui app scripting and for general embedding into C (/C++?), which is what all the game libs are written in. Lua only has a better "run-time": LuaJIT, but as that can't be used for many consoles, it's no use. The standard Lua interpreter is actually much slower.


# what's included?
System class is bare, basically with just print(), gc(), and clock()

optional modules Meta and Random can be added via compiler flags
  - Meta includes the interpreter and compiler functions

Fiber class is used for concurrency

the rest are just the standard types (strings, etc.)

these are the things that are included in the VM, and nothing more



# cli repl that includes libuv
because there is no standard library, it used libuv for concurrent io

https://github.com/wren-lang/wren-cli
  - test/os/process folder for process class and executing commands
  - test/io folder for file stuff

design patterns:

// no enums, use this:
class In {
  static jump { "jump" }
}



syntax:

var x = 4
var x:Num = 4 // type is inferred?
// no constants!

// no var += 1
// no var++

// string interpolation
Log.print("creating a pebble at `%(pebble.x) , %(pebble.y)`...")

class Hello {
    // **class fields must come first**
    // **and must be initialized**. can use any expression
    var value = 3
    var _field = 4 // TODO: maybe a C# property?

    // constructor
    construct new/create() {}
    object.new/create() // like ruby!
}

// no enums, use static vars in a class:
class Input {
  static left = "left"
  static right = "right"
}

each {|entity: Entity, pillar: Data|}

// input is a function, but no ()?
Frame.end { do-something() }

// hmmmm... TODO: try to comprehend some more..
Arcade.add_collision_callback(player) {|entity_a, entity_b, state, normal, overlap_dist|}

# standard lib classes:
https://wren.io/modules/

## object
// these show up in auto-completion for all objects

Object.same(o, o2) // same as == except it can't be overriden
o == o2 // value-types compared by value, all other types compared by "identity" (reference?)
o.is(o2) // also true if it contains any superclass
o.type // returns it's class

o.toString // used often via System.print(o)

## function
// "bare function when you don't want to immediately pass it as a block argument"
var printer = Fn.new { |arg|
  System.print(arg)     //> Hello world
}

printer.call("Hello world")


## other stuff

## num
var n:Num = 3
var n2:Num = 5
n.abs/cos/sin/etc // TODO: can call function without ()?
n.min(n2)/max(n2)/clamp(n2)
n.floor/ceil
n.sign
... lots of other goodies for games

// used to craete Range, most often used for loops
n..n2 // not including end number
n...n2 // including end number
