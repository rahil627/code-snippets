naming conventions:
avoid using the shift modifier key, otherwise must invert the -/_ key
- hyphens > underscores

- thingGroups > groupOfThings
  - thingGroup, thingSuperGroup is easier to auto-complete than groupOfThings, superGroupOfThings. Though the second way feels right to say English, the first way is better.

structure of a class / data bundle:
  - variables on top... make it possible to read from top to bottom being able to understand everything that’s going on without scrolling down. Let the auto-generated IDE stuff tell you the public API.

single header-file ideal:
  - try to put everything in one file, so that there are no dependencies beyond that one file. This makes it highly portable / distributable.



my naming conventions
My_Class
private-var vs -private-var
public-var
static-var
(no globals)



use this/self when possible, particularly in constructors

4 space indents
no tabs
one blank line between funtions
two blank lines between classes?

Most functions should be short enough that you won't have a zillion variables. If you have that many variables to tell apart, you have bigger fish to fry.
I want to be able to tell "simple" intrinsic types from full blown objects at a glance*. This distinction is important to me. Yeah, they're all still objects, but there are the common simple variables types we use 99% of the time (eg, String and Integer), and then there's everything else.
I want to be able to tell class level variables from local variables at a glance*. How far up do I need to scroll?
The variable names should be descriptive, readable and succinct.
I do not believe every single object needs a unique prefix. This is insane, and as the VB6 document illustrates, this way leads madness..
* At a glance means without having to mouse or cursor over the variable name, eg, it should work even in the high tech Notepad IDE.
I agree, I've switched to extremely short name / short scope local variables, too.

  - an interesting maxim to abide, but, maybe ‘causes too much refactoring!
