all OSs:
create different partitions for different OSs and select which one to boot into

VMs:
VMware
  - one of the standards, complete VM solution
Parallels
  - one of the standards, complete VM solution
VirtualBox
  - super simple, easy to add, delete, test, etc., often runs as an application *within* another OS, great for when you only need to use a select few apps from another OS
RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise L?)
  - used by my DigitalOcean server, probably more for "enterprise" industial use


Windows:

  - Windows Sub-system Linux (WSL) is a feature in Windows 10 that allows you to install Linux CLI, and perhaps in the future, Linux GUI too (it already kinda works?)  

Mac OS X:
generally requires specific hardware, so be sure to check "hackintosh" for the right parts before buying a computer, but ever since Mac OS X hardware switched to Intel, it's been pretty easy to find compatible laptops that make great hackintoshes
BootCamp
  - a native application to handle installing and booting into Windows (or any OS?)
