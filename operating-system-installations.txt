all OSs:
native install: create different disk partitions for different OSs and then select which one to boot into
  - this is true native installation, there are no comprimises, except disk space
  - this requires allocating disk space for a partition, but surely by now you can modify the amount of space partitioned?
  - you can access the other partitions file-system, but that's about it
  - for video games, it is best to have a native installation of Windows


VMs:
this technology has come a long way, even able to play games through them! i think you can now "bypass" your video card driver through to the VM

VMware
  - one of the standards, complete VM solution
Parallels
  - one of the standards, complete VM solution
VirtualBox
  - super simple, easy to add and easy to delete, often runs as an application *within* another OS, great for when you only need to use a select few apps from another OS, or for trying apps in other OSs, or for just playing with :)
RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise L?)
  - used by my DigitalOcean server, probably more for "enterprise" industial use, my server actually uses a "virtual GPU" too! it even handles current OpenGL (4.5) through "mesa" drivers!


Windows:
https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/
  - Windows Sub-system Linux (WSL) is a feature introduced in Windows 10 that allows you to install Linux CLI, and perhaps in the future, Linux GUI too (it already kinda works?). it's like an entire compatibility layer between native Windows powershell and Linux shells! So, you can write bash scripts and it will work on Windows just as it does on Linux, thus reducing the amount of shell languages you need to learn / keep in memory, and, enabling you to re-use the bajillion scripts already written in bash over the past 40 years

Mac OS X:
generally requires specific hardware, so be sure to check "hackintosh" for the right parts before buying a computer, but ever since Mac OS X hardware switched to Intel chip-sets, it's been pretty easy to find compatible laptops that make great hackintoshes

BootCamp
  - a native application to handle installing and booting into Windows (or any OS?), along with setting up all of the input/output drivers required. This worked like a dream on my 2010 and 2013 Macbooks, booting into Windows for games and Mac for production and every-day use
