all OSs:
native install: create different disk partitions for different OSs and then select which one to boot into
  - this is true native installation, there are no comprimises, except disk space
  - this requires allocating disk space for a partition, but surely by now you can modify the amount of space partitioned?
  - you can access the other partitions file-system, but that's about it
  - for video games, it is best to have a native installation of Windows


VMs:
this technology has come a long way, even able to play games through them! i think you can now "bypass" your video card driver through to the VM

VMware
  - one of the standards, complete VM solution
Parallels
  - one of the standards, complete VM solution
VirtualBox
  - super simple, easy to add and easy to delete, often runs as an application *within* another OS, great for when you only need to use a select few apps from another OS, or for trying apps in other OSs, or for just playing with :)
RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise L?)
  - used by my DigitalOcean server, probably more for "enterprise" industial use, my server actually uses a "virtual GPU" too! it even handles current OpenGL (4.5) through "mesa" drivers!


Windows:
https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/
  - Windows Sub-system Linux (WSL) is a feature introduced in Windows 10 that allows you to install Linux CLI, and perhaps in the future, Linux GUI too (it already kinda works?). it's like an entire compatibility layer between native Windows powershell and Linux shells! So, you can write bash scripts and it will work on Windows just as it does on Linux, thus reducing the amount of shell languages you need to learn / keep in memory, and, enabling you to re-use the bajillion scripts already written in bash over the past 40 years

Mac OS X:
generally requires specific hardware, so be sure to check "hackintosh" for the right parts before buying a computer, but ever since Mac OS X hardware switched to Intel chip-sets, it's been pretty easy to find compatible laptops that make great hackintoshes

BootCamp
  - a native application to handle installing and booting into Windows (or any OS?), along with setting up all of the input/output drivers required. This worked like a dream on my 2010 and 2013 Macbooks, booting into Windows for games and Mac for production and every-day use

Linux:
can begin with Ubuntu (server edition) until one is familiar with the cli, package managers, file-system, etc., then, move on to either Debian (server and desktop use) or Arch Linux (desktop-only use) for less bloat

"Unix (shell) has a philosophy that everything is a file. The input and output of a Unix command can be accessed like a file. This makes chaining command really simple and reusing the output of one command by another is the power of the Unix shell."

Ubuntu
  - built on top of Debian
  - has long-term-stable (LTS) releases for stability (once every two years), supported for a whopping 5 or even 10 years!!!
    - then interim releases once every 6 months
  - super stable for both server-side and desktop
  - desktop can be a tad bit bloated for some more advanced users
  - has sane config defaults
  - desktop, core, server versions
    - core only has snap, meanted for embedded devices
    - **server** doesn't come with a desktop, but is widely adopted for server use by all major cloud server companies
  - "Most Ubuntu editions and flavours simply install a different set of default packages compared to the standard Ubuntu Desktop. Since they share the same package repositories, all of the same software is available for each of them.[109][110] Ubuntu Core[a] is the sole exception as it only has access to packages in the Snap Store.[111"
    - Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc. are just Ubuntu with different desktop environments: KDE for Kubuntu, xfce for Xubuntu, and so on
  - although free, sorta run by the company Canonical
  
Debian
  - more so for developers, as it won't have the friendliness of Ubuntu (software center, etc.), nor sane config defaults
  - but that means it also won't have the bloat!
  - probably a good step from Ubuntu
  - super stable, maybe even more-so than Ubuntu as it has even less features to worry about
  - two version branches: stable (for enterprise-grade tested) every 6 months and testing (for current software)
  - Debian, abides 100% free software social cotract, thus no paid software in the package manager?
  - compleptely community-based

Fedora
  - ?

Arch Linux
  - abides KISS principle
  - completely customizable, no bloat
    - this can take time
  - good community, and great community-run package manager (AUR)
  - rolling release software update means very frequent updates
    - making it bad for server-side use, as stuff can break
  - install via terminal only, as it starts without a desktop
  
OpenSUSE
  - Leap and Tumbleweed versions
    - Leap for on-edge rolling release
    - Tumbleweed for slow rolling release
      - a very good option to get rolling release (latest software), but in a more stable manner than Arch and Leap
  
Linux Mint
  - like Ubuntu, another newer beginner-friendly distro built on top of Debian
  
Rocky Linux
  - super stable, super slow release cycle
