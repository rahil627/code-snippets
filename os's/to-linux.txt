to install an app manually:
copy the binary to /usr/bin/ for most distros
then you should be able to run the binary via command line

# distros
https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE/comments/x7ge7j/thinking_about_moving_from_arch_based_to_opensuse/

openSUSE
  - Tumbleweed
    - rolling release distro of openSUSE
    - OBS, OpenQA, snapper, BtrFs by default, YasT
    - AUR (arch's user repo) > OBS

  - Leap
    - intervalled release

debian
  - it works, stable as it gets
  - to use more recent packages, just download them using snaps, docker, etc.
    - benefits from being safe too
  - the main community-based distro





# customization (gui packages)
NOTE: cli apps 'n setup are listed in the-tui-dream.txt and setup.sh
the linux world is full of customization, like the way kids do for desktop computer hardware, bicycles, motorcycles, and cars.

  - /r/unixporn is full of ricers suping up their desktop environments


package managers:
native package managers:
  - each linux distro has it's own package manager: apt for debian, dnf for fedora, etc.
  - checked by the people that maintain the distro

non-native:
  - unchecked, includes all dependencies, making it easier for app-devs to maintain, good for bigger apps (like how Windows works?)
  - often sandboxed to make it safe from affecting the rest of the os
snap(d)
flatpak



desktop environments (DE):
  - contain everything: a windows manager, a taskbar, widgets, etc.

main:
KDE (Plasma)
  - highly customizable
mate
  - also well-received
cinnamon
gnome
  - used by ubuntu, old feeling

lightweight:
xfce
  - probably used for servers 'n old computers just to be remoted into
lxqt


custom:
compositers / WMs:
  - to put windows in the write place
sway
i3
wayland
  - used by chromeos
..?

They all suck in their own way.

vifm is quirky and feels slower than python-based ranger.

nnn is fast, but too unconfigurable and unusable.

mc is for admins that need a file manager on a remote machine, it's not better than the alternatives.

pcmanfm is too basic, thunar is too basic, QT-based (pcmanfm-qt, dolphin) suffer from a disappearing menus QT bug, and dolphin is kinda bloated and practically pulls in the whole KDE suite.

Choose something you like, I prefer ranger and use pcmanfm when I have to.
