to install an app manually:
copy the binary to /usr/bin/ for most distros
then you should be able to run the binary via command line

# distros

https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/zwqaxz/arch_user_convince_me_to_hop_to_nix/

NixOS
  - **reproducible env** via declarative configs
  - steep learning curve
    - uses a functional lang
  - NOTE: should use flakes
  - no games??

arch
  - rolling release system-packages + user-maintained user-packages
    - meaning, you must update the entire system every time you want to get package that uses another package (dependency) that has a release newer than your system
      - aka **you must update your entire system nearly every-time you want to get a package!!**
  - great wiki: documentation on everything, great way to learn linux
  - need to install your own backup software (BtrFs, etc.)

openSUSE
  - Tumbleweed
    - rolling release distro of openSUSE
    - OBS, OpenQA, snapper, BtrFs by default, YasT
    - AUR (arch's user repo) > OBS

  - **Leap**
    - **intervalled release**
    - otherwise, same as Tumbleweed

debian
  - it works, stable as it gets
  - to use more recent packages, just download them using snaps, docker, etc.
    - benefits from being safe too
  - the main community-based distro





# customization (gui packages)
NOTE: cli apps 'n setup are listed in the-tui-dream.txt and setup.sh
the linux world is full of customization, like the way kids do for desktop computer hardware, bicycles, motorcycles, and cars.

https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/themeing/dictionary/#wiki_rice/
  - /r/unixporn is full of ricers suping up their desktop environments


package managers:
native package managers:
  - each linux distro has it's own package manager: apt for debian, dnf for fedora, etc.
  - checked by the people that maintain the distro
native
nix

app (like windows) package managers:
  - unchecked, includes all dependencies, making it easier for app-devs to maintain, good for bigger apps (like how Windows works?)
  - often sandboxed to make it safe from affecting the rest of the os
flatpak
x/snap(d)
  - has political problems tied to Canonical (company of Ubuntu), forcing certain apps to use snap on Ubuntu




desktop environments (DE):
  - contain everything: a windows manager, a taskbar, widgets, etc.

main:
KDE (Plasma)
  - highly customizable
mate
  - also well-received
cinnamon
gnome
  - used by ubuntu, old feeling

lightweight:
xfce
  - often used for servers 'n old computers just to be remoted into
lxqt


custom:
compositers / WMs:
  - to put windows in the write place
sway
i3
wayland
  - used by chromeos
..?


tui file-managers:
see the-tui-dream.txt and setup.sh

gui file-managers:
https://www.reddit.com/r/swaywm/comments/ja93ss/comment/g8ojr1a/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&rdt=48122
They all suck in their own way.

vifm
  - quirky and feels slower than python-based ranger.

nnn
  - fast, but too unconfigurable and unusable.

mc
  - old school midnight commander

pcmanfm
  - too basic, thunar is too basic, QT-based (pcmanfm-qt, dolphin) suffer from a disappearing menus QT bug, and dolphin is kinda bloated and practically pulls in the whole KDE suite.

Choose something you like, I prefer ranger and use pcmanfm when I have to.


krusader

task-bar:
polybar
  - easy to customize

...



# linux apps (create a new file?)

gui text editors:
code (vs code)
kate

remote access apps:
chromeRDP
noVNC
  - vnc is the open-source remote tech
