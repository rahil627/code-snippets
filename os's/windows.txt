package managers:
winget
  - added to windows 10 sometime
  - installs to system, requires admin rights
chocolatey
  - community-organized
  - installs to system, requires admin rights
scoop
  - doesn't use msi installers which mess with the registry
  - thus oriented toward portable apps
  - installs to ~/scoop/, similar to snap

note: there's also windows sandbox to install stuff in temporarily

conclusion:
scoop when you can
winget for essentials to be integrated into windows
chocolatey vs windows store for others
  - chocolatey has the benefit of being able to automate
