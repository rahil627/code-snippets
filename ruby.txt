its also a funny way to write very clean simple scripts in a more functional style

tutorial:

make sure you have a good set-up: vs code with ruby extensions, nvim with vim-ruby, or whatever, ad this it should be pretty easy to just get completion for everything for a "everything is an object" language

these three chapters look useful: otherwise, it's just the same ol' programming stuff
