  - use ruby in the shell?? :o  
  
    
conclusion:
CLI shells combine a programming language ("shell language", "scripting language") with the terminal (the ability to execute commands, including running command-line programs... However, nowadays, many programming languages come with interpreters (in addition to compiler options) and the ability to execute commands (and process handling), so, the lines are blurry, and thus, given that fact, **i think it's better to invest time in a more powerful general programming langauge, especially if it can be run just as easily as a shell script can a la '!#/usr/bin/env lang' (general "scripting languages": ruby, python, etc., and even Lua), or even a *slight* bit extra code from compiled languages might be okay in cases of larger scripts. **Although, for very simple things, these are still nice to have, especially to simply and quickly save/run a "batch" of commands, without any bloat, and then run *those* scripts from another process (via another script, program, or even **service**), leading to automation. In the end, **Bash has the power of Linux CLI programs (tons, but most are ancient), and Powershell has the power of a great standard library: .NET library, in addition to being as powerful as a general programming language, and now with the recent additin of being cross-platform, bash has no benefits, save for the fact it was used since the beginning of computers. For people that are neiher a fan of .NET or even Microsoft, however, that choice doesn't make much sense, and it is best to choose a general scripting languge: basically, Ruby or Python, and my personal preference is Ruby, as it is perhaps my favorite programming language.*

Linux is definitely about it's CLI tools, and scripts are a way to string them together. It's just normal, how Linux works.

Windows, i feel, isn't as CLI heavy, so you won't be using it as often--you'd be using GUI apps--, and when you do, it's probably more in a programming way/feel (writing a program) rather than a quick script way/feel (that just runs a chain of commands--linux cli programs).

For Windows, you'd get more familiar with the .NET standard library, which'll transfer into C#. For Linux, you'd need to be savvy enough to be able to find useful CLI programs (could be written in bash or *any* other programming language*) in package managers or github, be able to use them, and then execute them in a script. As far as i know, Bash doesn't really have a standard library to do stuff(??). Whereas for Powershell, you can do everhything that Bash does, but you'd be more inclined to leverage it's programming power and it's standard library more, rather than rely on other CLI programs, written in god know whats langauge.

Linux is a mess of CLI programs and scripts, written in *tons* of different languages. Windows is a lot more insular, with just powershell (although of course you can install any language and run any script too). That's just the feeling i get.



# a note on seperation
a shell's terminal can be used without every using it's scripting language, and vice versa, so, choose both seperately. You can use fish with bash scripts, or zsh with fish scripts. It doesn't really matter. Only that you'd need to install a zsh(?) or fish interpreter to run them.

  - compare with zsh



## thoughts

bash (and i believe even zsh??) is janky, with strange things for strings, math, and old syntax using `$` everywhere, including for special vars `$#`, making it feel something closer to Perl or PHP, both of which are old and cryptic to me (see the ~"fish for bash users" link for a good overview of the many problems of bash). A ton of things are confused due to syntax, especially sub-shells vs command substitutions. Also the escaping quotes with strings is awful... **Yeah, fuck bash. It's either fish (or zsh?) or a proper scripting language.**




## research
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11369522/bash-utility-script-library#11369935
  - i think i was pondering on why there's no bash standard library
  - the answer points out bash's limitations really well, mainly:
  - "**Bash functions don't return anything; they only produce output streams. Every reasonable method of capturing that stream and either assigning it to a variable or passing it as an argument requires a SubShell, which breaks all assignments to outer scopes.** (See also BashFAQ/084 for tricks to retrieve results from a function.) **Thus, libraries of reusable functions are not feasible, as you can't ask a function to store its results in a variable whose name is passed as an argument** (except by performing eval backflips)."




# terminals

all OSs / terminal emulators:

alacritty
  - OpenGL, contemporary terminal and terminal multiplexor (basically managing multiple terminal instances)
  - "vi mode"
  - made by the Rust community

Windows:
you have no choice, it's just powershell

although, you can install Linux (via WSL), and i think there's a bash shell now too (though, without the linux tools, i'm not so sure how useful it would be..., so you'd be much better off just installing a desktop-less minimalistic linux distro, and get the best of both worlds)

powershell
  - more like a programming lanugage, like VB.NET, making it more comparable to python than bash
  - have acess to the .NET library and a few other important libs (??), which makes it a nice step to C#
  - has a pipeline operator
  - "With Windows PowerShell, as far as I know, everything is an object. You can pass the result of a command to another as an object. This can be really powerful, but it does not have the simple concept (everything is a file) of Unix."



Linux:

https://www.howtogeek.com/68563/HTG-EXPLAINS-WHAT-ARE-THE-DIFFERENCES-BETWEEN-LINUX-SHELLS/
  - a good straight-foward tech post abuot the history of shells
  
https://hyperpolyglot.org/unix-shells
  - a great web-site, comparing many shell langs and providing some history too
  
basically:

the old bourne-like shells:
sh = bourne shell
  - the main precursor and origin to/of the most popular future shells
bash = bourne again shell
  - most prevalent, used on all desktop Linux-derived OSs, including Mac OS X
  - history: was created by open-source people GNU while they were creatin their free OS
ash = Almaquish shell
  - a light-wieght sub-set(?) of bash used in embeded systems
  - you can find it on the tiny Linux distros installed on mobile devices, sch as ArchLinux, which itself uses BusyBox
    - i personally have "iSH" app on my iOS device, and this thing is lightning fast!!!, this is actually where i played with and learned vi: because it was *so* much faster than using CLI with my server
    

the current bourne-like shells:
dash = ? Almaquish shell
  - based on ash, and therefore also light-weight, quick
  - used internally by Ubuntu to handle shell tasks/services/scripts as it's lighter 'n faster: ~100kb! (compared to 1mb)
  
zsh = z? shell
  - a super-set of bash, used on contemporary desktop systems
  - **Mac OS X recently replaced bash with this**, thus making it the current standard
  - more features, more configurability, etc. **it's basically the neovim of shells. There's plug-in managers, infinite plugins, everything you could dream of.**
  - by default the shell is quite bare, especially compared to fish which ships with auto-completion/auto-suggestion, syntax highlighting, spell-checking, ignoring input mistakes, etc. However, there are plugins for all of these (to directly compete), and more.
 

the newer stuff, post-bourne:
fish
  - "a beginner-friendly shell" that ships with contemporary functionality: auto-suggestion & auto-completion, highlighting for errors, spell-checking, colors, etc.
  - "If you want to make your command line more productive, more useful, and more fun, without learning a bunch of arcane syntax and configuration options, then fish might be just what youâ€™re looking for!"
  - "a shell for the 90s" lol
  - not POSIX compliant
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48732986/why-how-fish-does-not-support-posix
      - cannot run a script with `#!/bin/sh`, you'd need `#!/usr/bin/fish`, and the user would need a fish interpreter installed
      - you cannot simply copy-paste snippets of scripts from the net and expect them to work
      - **basically, it's just a different language, so treat it like so**
      - **this is a problem of standards, because really, none of the shells are POSIX-compliant!**
        - (see link in comments section of the SO question)
  - although the syntax and semantics are indeed better, it doesn't change much from the normal POSIX stuff (bash, etc.), which is strange--why not just create a completely new lang(?), closer to python/ruby! The trade-off is tough: lose the ability to share the scripts that you write (will people install a fish interpreter?), and although you can simply still use bash-like scripts, it's just confusing to add yet another language with such little differences: because *it is precisely those little differences that will become bugs!*
   - having said all that, it's still a great shell to install, use, out-of-the-box, sane defaults, etc. etc. There's no need to actually use the fish scripting language. You can just continue to use bash scripts.
   - it's a great stepping stone to the more bare zsh, where you'd need to configure quite a bit to get it to fish-level. Consider fish as **zsh with a solid starter config kit**
   - it's also awesome for "dev ops", so they can just enter workstations/servers, quickly install fish, and continue with life
   - it's also a much better idea to allow the makers of fish to choose and update the shell rather than configuring yet another linux thing--neovim config is arduous enough!!
   - update: as it turns out, fish is just a much newer design, all around: aliases are simple functions (with lazy-loading!), strings are arrays (thus saving you from parsing and accessing words 'n args), strings are escaped properly (don't need to worry about "v" vs $"v", or whatever), and theres prolly a ton more stuff like this. So, even without the language, it just seems overall better to ditch old "posix standardized" bash, zsh, and ofher variants
   - **also has vi *and* emacs mode!**
   
   
elvish
  - https://elv.sh
  - seems fishy
  - **directory history *and* command history search seperated** (programs and shortcut)
  - file-manager (program and shortcut)
  - simple syntax, like fish
  - a little std lib?
  - more pipeline power?
  - overall looks very cool! can try it out :)

  
  
others:
csh, tcsh, one other one = c shell, improved c shell, ane one other one
  - C-like shell with more scripting ability than the bourne shell? A bit dated now..?
