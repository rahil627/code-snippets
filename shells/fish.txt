  - smarter cross-shell prompt?


config files:
~/.config/fish/
  - main dir

~/.config/fish/config.fish
  - main config file, i think can just throw everything in here

~/.config/fish/fish_variables

~/.config/fish/conf.d/
  - empty, maybe for keeping modular config files?

~/.config/fish/functions/
  - each function has it's own file

~/.config/fish/completions/
  - ?




aliases:
alias
  - adds an alias to current sessions memory
alias -s
  - saves it into a function in ~/.config/fish/function/
unalias
  - remove an alias, and hopefully function too?
