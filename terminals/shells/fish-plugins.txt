  - this plug-in manager is a plug-in!

PatrickF1/fzf.fish
  - pop fzf bindings
  - TODO: should make your own
  - note: requires fzf installation to work

jorgebucaran/autopair.fish
nickeb96/puffer-fish
gazorby/fish-abbreviation-tips
  - stuff that should be included in fish

# TODO: experimenting with prompts:
# ilancosman/tide@v5
  - the best prompt thingy, but i def don't want anymore stuff to customize, ugh!
    - seems overkill
  - see github repo for instructions

jorgebucaran/hydro
  - a minimialist, lag-free prompt thingy
  - can compare this to the native one
    - this one seems good enough for me! simple, no customization, like fish! :)
