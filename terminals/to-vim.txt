TODO: merge old vim configs to NVChad?

nvim bundles:
LazyVim
  - most minimalist, should prolly start with this
LunarVim
AstroVim
  - most featureful, can use this and take what i want from it to lazyvim
NVChad
  - configs seems overly abstracted...

NVChad
setup:
NOTE: you will have to delete your configs folder
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1 && nvim

https://nvchad.com/docs/config/walkthrough#config_structure
~/.config/nvim/lua/custom
  - contains the example starter config files


use:

# basics
space - doomemacs-like shortcut cheat-sheet preview
;
'


# plugins
# this command starts the plugin manager gui
:Mason

# install a plugin
:MasonInstall solargraph


# config
https://github.com/NvChad/example_config

.nvchadrc <- plugins.lua <- overrides.lua

overrides
  - seems to abstract config options from a plugin... it all seems very very redundant
