chromeos terminal
  - size 13-16
  - noto sans mono, 16

vs code
  - size 13-14, but has custom dpi (exec on start)
  - source code pro, 13
  - fira mono
    - for some reaason, fira mono is more seriphy than noto sans mono on terminal, and the inverse is true for vs code

current favorite:
source code pro
  - source code pro semibold is a great idea too

mesloLGS nf ~= fira code ~= dejavu sans mono
JetBrains sans mono <- dejavu sans mono

MesloLSG NF
  - NF = nerd font
  - just fixes smybol positions from dejavu sans mono
  - The recommended font is the product of many individuals. Its origin is Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, which has given birth to Menlo, which in turn has spawned Meslo. Finally, extra glyphs have been added to Meslo with scripts forked from Nerd Fonts. The final font is released under the terms of Apache License.

fira code
  - adds space width, adds some serif-ness

JetBrains sans mono
  - a cute robotic version of dejavu, with long characters shortened nicely

dejavu sans mono == noto sans mono? ~= roboto mono
  - default
  - more line space on odd numbers, compare size 12 and 13
  - size 14 is nice 'n big, i dig it

PowerLine (bundle)
  - bundle of fonts from the popular PowerLevel10k zsh bundle
  - forked from source code pro
  - https://github.com/powerline/fonts
  - contains all of the fonts here!
  - TODO: try some of these, then uninstall this, keeping only what you need
  - source code pro for powerline uses a more bold font (medium?) and adds:
    - bad: bottom serif to 'i', lowers the '_',
    - good: otherwise does many good things like: a better 'g', bigger symbols, aligned symbols, etc.

source code pro
  - a classic
  - more sans than dejavu! very clear 'n spacey
  - by Adobe
  - git clone --depth 1 --branch release https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro.git ~/.fonts/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro
  - fc-cache -f -v ~/.fonts/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro

Cantarell
  - used by Manjaro for ui elements

Cousine
  - squashes the f and l, i prefer it longer
  - too wide

inconsolata
  - a classic
  - open source consolas, though not as good as the original

consolas
  - on Windows computers, closed-source?
