  - try fonts here!

fonts.google.com
  - use this site to check out contemporary pop fonts
  - although you can download them here, for linux, should use package managers
  - in order to use with crostini apps, might have to put them into the linux folders (see archwiki)
    - /usr/share/fonts or a local dir (/.fonts/ is deprecated)

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fonts
  - also a great resource, listing some pop font packages and more resources

https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&repo=Extra&q=ttf&maintainer=&flagged=
  - ttf search of the arch package repo

https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts
  - another good pop collection

chromeos terminal
  - size 13-16
  - noto sans mono, 16
  - change font color to be slightly transparent (terminal settings -> appearance)

vs code
  - size 11-14, but has custom dpi (exec on start)
  - source code pro, 11
  - fira mono
    - for some reaason, fira mono is more seriphy than noto sans mono on terminal, and the inverse is true for vs code

chrome (browser/OS?)
font size: 18
strandard: carlito
serif: georgia
sans: arimo
fixed-width: roboto

  - calling code
  - code saver


current favorite:
**source code pro / hasklig**
  - terminal: size 10-11, thickness: medium
  - vscode: size 13, thickness: (default) regular

mononoki
  - trying in terminal

**meslo**
  - also really good, competitive to source code pro

hasklig <- source code pro
mesloLGS nf ~= fira mono <- dejavu sans mono
hack <- dejavu sans mono & fira
jetbrains (sans) mono <- dejavu sans mono
mononoki > cascadia code ~= fira code > anonymous pro (seriphy)


MesloLSG NF
  - NF = nerd font
  - just fixes smybol positions from dejavu sans mono
  - The recommended font is the product of many individuals. Its origin is Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, which has given birth to Menlo, which in turn has spawned Meslo. Finally, extra glyphs have been added to Meslo with scripts forked from Nerd Fonts. The final font is released under the terms of Apache License.

hasklig
  - source code pro + ligatures (->, =>, etc.)

mononoki
  - a cute seriphy, game'ish font
  - the bold is great, very sans-serif
  - designed for code review, as "every character is designed to be clearly distinguishable

cascadia code
  - very gamey 'n seriphy, like mononoki and fira code
    - too seriphy
  - high quality, showing surprising thickness like consolas
  - used by Microsoft for it's terminal

fira code
  - adds space width, adds some serif-ness, probably has code-related glyphs
  - i prefer mono

JetBrains (sans) mono
  - a cute robotic version of dejavu, with long characters shortened nicely

hack
  - a contemporary version of dejavu
  - somewhere between dejavu and fira's serphiness

dejavu sans mono == noto sans mono? ~= roboto mono
  - tall'ish
  - more line space on odd numbers, compare size 12 and 13
  - size 14 is nice 'n big, i dig it

PowerLine (bundle)
  - bundle of fonts from the popular PowerLevel10k zsh bundle
  - https://github.com/powerline/fonts
  - contains all of the fonts here!
  - TODO: try some of these, then uninstall this, keeping only what you need
  - source code pro for powerline uses a more bold font (medium?) and adds:
    - bad: bottom serif to 'i', lowers the '_',
    - good: otherwise does many good things like: a better 'g', bigger symbols, aligned symbols, etc.

source code pro
  - a classic
  - more sans than dejavu! very clear 'n spacey
  - great in small sizes
  - by Adobe (but i guess it's now open-source)
  - git clone --depth 1 --branch release https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro.git ~/.fonts/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro
  - fc-cache -f -v ~/.fonts/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro

Cantarell
  - used by Manjaro for ui elements

Cousine
  - squashes the f and l, i prefer it longer
  - too wide

Anonymous Pro
  - a bit serify, gothic, very round

Meslo
  - open-source customized menlo
  - AUR packages are "Meslo LG [S/M/L]" and ttf-menlo-nerd
    - nerd take 160mb :(

Menlo
  - a customized Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
  - Apple Font
    - used by Apple's dev tools 'n terminal

Inconsolata
  - open source consolas, though not as good as the original
  - maybe too scrunched up? tall? round
  - something always felt wrong about this one...

consolas
  - a classic
  - on Windows computers, closed-source? i think it came with VS Studio... it's the C# font



others:
hermit
  - future gui feel, but really nice! unique
lilex
  - eh.. has some seriphy robotiness to it
