  - very good
  - lists all current engines and frameworks
  - lists many useful game dev libraries

https://github.com/nadako/awesome-haxe
  - more personal, toward developing the haxe langauge
  
the codebook is especially good for learning bit-by-bit, especially for macros!


  
# forums
just a note: i've got quite a few posts on the Heaps forum... but it seems the Discord is a better place


# libs
https://github.com/haddock7/hlimgui
  - imgui bindings
  
  
# haxe cli
can either use the cli or create an hxml file, where each line is a command argument

haxe --main MainClass --interp
  - for interpreter
  
or, via buildFile.hxml file:
--interp
--main MainClass
-lib heaps (installed via haxelibs)
-cp sourceFolder

then run haxe buildFile.hxml
  
  
haxe --main MainClass -js app.js
  - results in app.js and app.map.js (or something like that)
  - then you need to create a basic HTML page to include the script
  
haxe --main MainClass -hl build.hl
  - be sure to `haxelib install hashlink`
  - results in a single file build.hl containing bytecode
  - todo: maybe has other arguments for generating a C binary

haxe --main MainClass -cpp build
  - be sure to `haxelib install hashlink`
  - results with a folder build, including generated C++ sources and bin(aries)


# haxelibs
haxelib searchRegEx
haxelib install someLibrary




# set-up
scripting?:
i think Haxe has top-level functions, so don't even need a class?

since Haxe comes with an interpreter, it's pretty simple to run a script using the haxe command:
`haxe --main ScriptName --interp`


otherwise, there are the following options for more scripting power:

hscript
  - https://lib.haxe.org/p/hscript/
    - ??

wrapper method
  - https://github.com/haxelime/hxp
    - `var hxml = new HXML ({ cp: ["src"], main: "Main", js: "bin/index.js" });`
      `hxml.build ();`
    - extend hxp.Script to get CLI-like argument handling, perhaps a bit more complex than just Sys.args()
    

haxelib method
  - i was told in Discord
