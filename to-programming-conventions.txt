Code design
Code is designed for portability, maintainability and clarity.
Naming should be clear and concise, not overly verbose.

Code conventions
General conventions to follow.

code is for humans ONLY. write it that way. YES
always always use braces. no exceptions. HMMM
egyption style braces (same line open, close inline) YES
closing brace comments when size of scope is more than a few lines SURE
closing brace comments on functions, classes, typedefs etc (as, these grow) SURE
single line code is not good. use multiple lines, they are free. YES
try to comment WHY not what, code should be self describing OKAY, THX
always descriptive names, a, b, c are not names. EVEN IN MATH?
function example() {

        //bad. no braces, single line code. YES
    if(true) return;

        //good YES, BUT I LIKE IT WITHOUT BRACES HERE ;(
    if(true) {
        return;
    }

} //example
Classes
public variables always first YES
after public variables, group properties together YES
private variables next YES
methods - constructor/init first, then destroy/cleanup YES
methods - public facing api higher up YES
methods - internal api next YES
methods - private/internal/utility functions last YES

class format guidelines
two lines gap
between imports and package MEH, 1 IS FINE
between imports and class declaration MEH, 1 IS FINE
between class declaration and member declaration MEH, 1 IS FINE
between member declaration and functions YES
between last function and close brace YES
one line gap at the end of the file YES
