server-side languages:
ruby
  - like Haxe, seems to have a nice cult community of hackers :)
  - also like Haxe, whereas Haxe devs tend to write object-oriented programs, Ruby in itself *is* object-oriented
    - these two points make it my personal choice
    
python
  - most popular and most loved

javascript
  - an old dynamic front-end rather mundane language that has over time become used for everything because of the abundance of web devs, including server-side
  - through Node.js, Express.js, etc. 'middle-ware" frameworks, it can then be used server-side
  - dynamic typing, retarded manual type checking (===, NaN, etc.)
