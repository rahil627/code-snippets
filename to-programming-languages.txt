# a language for every application

for simple fun web server hackery :D
  - it should have an interpreter, so that you can run it via cli
  - it should be able to run server-side (interpreter) and client-side (VM)
  
for games (and other "creative" applications that use various input/output hardwares) :D
  - it should have the option of memory management, for fine-tuning intense computations on both the CPU and the GPU
  - it should interop or embed to C/C++
  - it should be designed to be cross-platform (not sure how..)
  
  
as far as i know, only Haxe fits all of the above requirements... i'm not sure how C# really works, and i haven't touched dart.






# server-side languages:
usually have an interpreter so that you can run it ("in run-time") via CLI with single commands or scripts, as opposed to having to be compiled *and then* ran

## the standards
**haxe**
  - **my favorite** language
  - compiled, static-typed
  - runs on front-end and back-end
  - can interop with C/C++
    - can even automatically generate the bindings!
  - **can compile to any language, including C**
    - but beware, this route would probably make it hard to debug
  - **compiles to bytecode then is run through a very fast VM (Neko, HashLink), like Lua**
  - made by one French guy

ruby
  - like Haxe, seems to have a nice cult community of hackers :)
    - this alone makes it much more appealing to me than the other pop general languages
  - also like Haxe, whereas Haxe devs tend to write object-oriented programs, Ruby in itself *is* object-oriented
  - quite slow :(
  - made by one Japanese guy
    
python
  - most popular and most loved
  - can interop with C/C++
  - dynamic
  - pretty slow, though faster than ruby
  
java
  - similar to C++ but without memory management (pointers)
  - similar to Haxe in that it is converted down to bytecode and then run through a VM (JVM)
  
 
## not really server-side, but it's possible to build web apps!
C#
  - **through ASP.NET Core, can build cross-platform apps (including web** via WebAssembly)
    - this makes it a great choice, competing with not just web apps, but Google's Flutter, and even simple game-like apps.
  - Avalonia framework
    - like Flutter, but with C#/.NET/VS :o
  - Uno framework
    - like Flutter, a little different in implementation, more mobile-oriented, including hot-reloading :o
  - for a long time this only worked with Windows servers (IIS), thus making it less popular, but since ASP.NET *Core* in around 2015, it has since then become open-source, cross-platform (along with VS Code!), making MicroSoft look much better to the dev communities than both Google and Apple!
  - the con of this is that you need a solid development environment: the current version of Visual Studio (not VS Code), probably a Windows IIS server(??), and still need to compile the code, build it, then deploy it, making the entire build process far more cumbersome compared to the common server-side langugaes, where you can just go in with a terminal, edit some code, 'n run it all via CLI
  - however, **for big, serious projects, it's worth the powerful language (C#), framework (.NET), and environment (VS), all of which are perhaps considered some of the best**
  - C# also has one of the biggest dev communities
  
dart
  - Google's Haxe
  - used for the cross-platform (including web) Flutter framework
  - i personally don't trust Google in general, as they never work with the dev communities, never update their software, and often abandon their own software, making very strange one-off products
  - is it even open-source!?!?

  
  
## contemporary
i'm not sure if any of these are good for server-side stuff..

Nim
  - basically supports all programming paradigms
  - interface with C and compiles to javascript
Rust
  - like C++ but safe
Pony
  - lol, i like this idea, extremely statically typed, so that it's never a question, no concept of memory management
  
  
  
# others
kotlin
  - Google replaced java with this for their Android devices
  - i'm guessing it interops/embeds with java
  - i don't know anymore about it..

perl
  - i've always viewed this as a terse, perplexing langauge, like regex
  - seems to have the reputation that only old veteran hackers have ever mastered it
  - embeds/interops with C/C++?
  
scala
  - allows for both object-oriented paradign and functional paradigm, thus making it less popular compared to solely object-oriented languages
  - uses java's VM: JVM, thus making it work seamlessly alongisde java?

javascript
  - an old dynamic front-end rather mundane language that has over time become used for everything because of the abundance of web devs, including server-side
  - through Node.js, Express.js, etc. 'middle-ware" frameworks, it can then be used server-side
  - dynamic typing, retarded manual type checking (===, NaN, etc.)

PHP
  - perhaps the only thing worse than javascript, and perhaps closest to the horror that is objective-c
  - have you ever seen WordPress?.. :sob:
