IDEs:
Microsoft Visual Studio
  - the standard
  - more C# focused?
  
  - versions
    - Visual Studio 20xx
    - Visual Studio for Mac
    - Visual Studio Code
      - more like a suped up text editor?
      - cross-platform (vis Electron)
    
Intellij IDEA
  - top competitor?
  - more Java focused?
    
JetBrains Rider
  - i think they create IDEs specific to and specialized for each language
    - .net
    - ...
    - etc.
  
others??

defunct:
most IDEs are now dead due to VS Code's dominance. It being cross-platform, open-source, community-oriented, all helped it sky-rocket.



text editors:

cli:
vim (neovim, etc.)
  - *classic*, cli
  - modal (reading(?), insert, visual, command(?))
  - *heavily* key-board input user interface focused
  
  
emacs
  - *classic*, cli, competitor to vim
  - much more than a text editor...


simple, default OS text editor replacements:
notepad++
  - a Windows classic
  
textmate
  - a Mac classic
  - not sure if still in use...


main competition:
sublime text
  - perhaps the current most popular and loved text editor, the victor vs atom
  
many others... (todo)

atom
  - ...people don't seem to like this one...
