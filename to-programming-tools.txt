IDEs:
Microsoft Visual Studio
  - Visual Studio 20xx
  - Visual Studio for Mac
  - Visual Studio Code
    - more like a suped up text editor?
    - cross-platform (vis Electron)
    
Intellij IDEA
  - top competitor?
  - more Java focused?
    
JetBrains Rider
  - i think they create IDEs specific to and specialized for each language
  
others??



text editors:
vim (neovim, etc.)
  - classic, cli
  - modal (reading(?), insert, visual, command(?))
  - *heavily* key-board input user interface focused
  
  
emacs
  - classic, cli, competitor to vim
  - much more than a text editor...
