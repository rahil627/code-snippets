difference between pointer and reference (in C)
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4995899/difference-between-pointer-and-reference-in-c
    - a very very good answer!
    - basically: reference is like a goto, there is no memory allocated for it
    - pointer is actual data, and has memory allocated for it ("dereferencing" it leads to whatever it's pointing at)
