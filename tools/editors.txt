gui editors:

newer stuff:
x/lapce
  - a vs-code copy in rust
    - in development
    - incredible speed
    - likely will become abandoned after the rust-wave

current standard:
**vs code**

old standards:
x/sublime
x/atom
  - i missed out on this generation
notepad++
  - same as ever, still cute and functional for an old 90s thing


terminal editors:
mostly for the key-bindings, then can use an extension on vscode

**helix**
  - the best of both worlds: vim and emacs
  - many pop-up menus similar to doom-emacs
  - based on kakoune

old standards:
neovim
  - lua scripting for configs 'n plugins!
    - used to be terrible vimscript
  - various packages
  - bad learning curve
emacs
  - elisp macros
    - actually a joy to use (especially when compared to vimscript!)
  - mature, well-written plugins
  - org-mode
  - "m-x is godsend"
  - slow startup time
  - **doom**
     - intuitive space-bar menu to ease learning 
     - evil-mode to use vim-keybindings
  - space
    - ?




IDEs:
mostly langauge-specific

generally adds these features: integrated interactive debugger, profiler, advanced code completion, advanced refactoring, better file navigation (go to definition in deep libraries 'n back), tasks runner (including tests), database integration

vs studio
  - C++/C#
  - the most advanced features

various IDEs by JetBrains
  - rubymine
    - (for ruby)
  - intellij
    - java, jvm langs?

I keep trying to switch off of Rubymine and I keep going back. Debugging in Code is good enough, like no issue, once you find the right combination of articles to help you set it up. Autocomplete, intellisense, and similar are much worse, whether you use Solargraph or Sorbet + Ruby-LSP, and there are essentially zero refactoring actions. But the real killer feature for me is that Rubymine let’s me search, add breakpoints in, or jump to a definition in gems used in my application.

But the real real killer feature is that it all just works, no hassle. Sure it’s a little sluggish sometimes. Sure the interface is a lil heavy. Sure the plug-in ecosystem is way less active. I got work to do, damnit.

VSCode sits somewhere between Sublime/Atom and Rubymine. It's not a full IDE, nor will it ever be, but it has a lot of the features a full-featured IDE would have. I used it for a while but just switched away from it, simply because there are UI things that really bother me, like the fonts support, particularly in the sidebar and the search. I work on projects with thousands of files and a hard-to-read search just doesn't work for me. And the ruby/rails support is sub-par, at best, compared to others.

I've found Atom can do everything VSCode did for me (though maybe not for others) and it looks better, which makes me more willing to spend time in it. Sure, that's not everyone's requirement, but it is for me.

I switched away from Sublime to VSCode, not because Sublime was bad, but I needed a change. But Sublime is absolutely the best in terms of speed.

I personally don't find the need for something like Rubymine, but I've been writing Rails code for, jeez, 10+ years. It just gets in my way and never does what I think it should do. But it may be for you. VSCode is free, and Rubymine has a trial/demo. Try them. Spend a week or two with each. You'll find things you like and don't like about both. Everyone's needs and wants are different, and there are reasons some people love VIM over anything else. Just try them out.
