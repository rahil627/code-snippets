all OSs / terminal emulators:
  - generally: a *ton* of features over an actual basic terminal: GPU rendering (OpenGL)

next gen:
warp

contemporary incarnations of classic terminals:
zellij

**alacritty**
  - "a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but allows for extensive configuration."
    - very fish-like, just works, no config needed
  - "By integrating with other applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality..."
    - meant to combine your own terminal multiplexor (tmux), and other apps
  - GPU-rendering via OpenGL
  - "vi mode"
    - fish only covers the prompt, this covers the entire buffer!
  - made with Rust

kitty
  - overview
    - https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#sessions
    - philosophies: keyboard power-user oriented, simple / modular / extensible / hackable, simple configs
    - tabs + windows
    - layouts / compositer
      - **i'm personally not sure about using learning kitty's layout system, over a geneal linux compositer...**
    - **remote control**
      - control other terminal windows
      - "More usefully, you can pipe the output of a command running in one window to another window, for example:"
        - ls | kitty @ send-text --match title:Output --stdin
          - this is nice, **instead of creating new windows and tabs all the time, just use one window for input, then output everything to other windows 'n tabs**
    - startup sessions
      - to **create workspaces**
        - maybe can even just save a workspace
    - a few built-in extensions
      - ssh from terminal made simpler
        - **i personally still think a ssh/sftp file manager GUI is much simpler**
        - "remote file"
          - ls --hyperlink=auto, brings up a few hyperlinked commands, just click to download, open in editor, etc.
        - transfer
          - kitty +kitten transfer /path/to/local/file /path/to/destination/on/remote/computer
          - kitty +kitten transfer file1 dir1 destination/
       - "broadcast"
         - broadcast input from one terminal to multiple other terminals
           - amazing for dev-ops, saving one from writing scripts
  - written in C
  - super scriptable: api to control it; open tab/window/etc.
  - super extensible: "kittens", written in python
  - overall a whole 'nother layer of customization and complexity


wayland DE only:
**foot**
  - "A fast, lightweight and minimalistic Wayland terminal emulator"
  - very fast
  - according to the maker of NotCurses tui lib, this one is awesome if you use Wayland

  - didn't read through much, but in general it seems kitty > alacritty
  - foot is mentioned
