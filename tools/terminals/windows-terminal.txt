by default it generally uses c+s for shortcuts, but i changed it to use alt for most shortcuts
  - new tab (t), new window (n), copy/paste (c/v), find (f), etc.

alo by default it uses ctrl for signals and two command-line-related shortcuts
  - c+c, c+l, and every other letter
    - send ^C, ^L signal
    - TODO: can remap these to more command-line-only functions
      - fzf
        - fzf paths
        - fzf history (see provided history searches)
      - fzf env vars
      - etc.
  - c+r
    - **reverse history search** (bck-i-search)
  - c+s # TODO: why s?
    - forward history search? (fwd-i-search)
    


some defaults:
c+,
  - settings
c+s+,
  - settings.json
c+a+,
  - open default settings.json

c+s+d
  - duplicate tab


my shortcuts:

generally change all modifier-key shortcuts to alt (+alt-shift, alt-control-shift), so it doesn't conflict with terminal apps, especially helix/text-editors

split window panes:
a+s+'+/-' -> a-s-j/l (TODO: maybe v/h is better, to preserve for resize pane shortcuts)
  - split vertically/horizontally
  - kinda strange, but might share shortcut with vs-code

alt+arrows
  - window pane navigation
