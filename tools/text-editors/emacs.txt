**DOOM**
  - i had a great initial experience using this, felt wayyyy easier and way more intuitive than using neovim!
  - "tailored for Emacs bankruptcy veterans who want less framework in their frameworks, a modicum of stability (and reproducibility) from their package manager, and the performance of a hand rolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your own config or a resource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite operating system."
  - "fast, closer to metal, opinionated, no forced plug-ins, nix/guix"
  - 150 modules!
  - "If you want something closer to what you know, and less involved to customize (less barebones basically), doom is what you want."
  - I have tried them both and vanilla as well. I like doom the best - it has better shortcuts out the box, less buggy, uses traditional elisp for configuration as opposed to spacemacs which uses a proprietary thing you have to learn.
prelude
  - way more stripped down, much closer to vanilla emacs
  - Prelude is basically a very light starter kit, whereas doom is a whole garage full of tools. (This does not mean doom has more utility, it just comes with more going on out of the box)
x/spacemacs
  - "a community-drive emacs distro"
    - sounds like 'oh my zsh', which is *not* good


doom install:
follow the directions on the github
fish_add_path ~/.config/emacs/bin

notes:

from github repo page:
doom sync
  - to synchronize your private config with Doom by installing missing packages, removing orphaned packages, and regenerating caches. Run this whenever you modify your private init.el or packages.el, or install/remove an Emacs package through your OS package manager (e.g. mu4e or agda).
doom upgrade
  - to update Doom to the latest release & all installed packages.
doom doctor
  - to diagnose common issues with your system and config.
doom env
  - to dump a snapshot of your shell environment to a file that Doom will load at startup. This allows Emacs to inherit your PATH, among other things.
doom build to recompile all installed packages (use this if you up/downgrade Emacs).



post-install notes:
But before you doom yourself, here are some things you should know:

1. Don't forget to run 'doom sync', then restart Emacs, after modifying
   ~/.doom.d/init.el or ~/.doom.d/packages.el.

   This command ensures needed packages are installed, orphaned packages are
   removed, and your autoloads/cache files are up to date. When in doubt, run
   'doom sync'!

2. If something goes wrong, run `doom doctor`. It diagnoses common issues with
   your environment and setup, and may offer clues about what is wrong.

3. Use 'doom upgrade' to update Doom. Doing it any other way will require
   additional steps. Run 'doom help upgrade' to understand those extra steps.

4. Access Doom's documentation from within Emacs via 'SPC h d h' or 'C-h d h'
   (or 'M-x doom/help')

Have fun!
