remap holding down caps lock to alt
use modes, as they are far more intuitive, showing you shortcuts every-time you activate a mode. naturally, you will customize those modes over time, removing what you don't need, and adding what you want
put shortcuts i forget on my custom mode



basic ergonomics:
just move or swap some useful keys around
  - simple, yet major

on a windows keyboard, swap alt with control on the os level
  - much more ergonomic, for both hands! mac os style!
  - on windows, use powertoys to re-map keys

map caps lock to escape key
  - especially for vi-like key-mappings

TODO: map holding caps lock down to the further mod key

**modifier keys require more cognitive load compared to leader-keys/key-chords, especially without a pop-up display.** It's sort of like object-oriented programming, the mind is better able to off-load the cognitive load to the object: the leader-key/minor-mode.

key mnemonics aren't really as useful since key-layouts can entirely change, though, perhaps not so useless, as you can still use the differently-positioned keys. Also, the other keyboard layouts aren't entirely different; sometimes, just a few keys are changed, particularly the home row only has a few changes.


pop-up menus / **minor-modes** / leader-keys:
  - i prefer the word minor-mode for this idea, as pop-up menu doesn't signify the complete idea
  - just to think about a bit..

my additional modes:
terminal controls
buffer controls
window pane/view controls (window mode in helix)
  - combine with buffer controls?

helix modes:
https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html#minor-modes
command
  - better to go straight to command picker
space
  - all pickers
goto
goto next/prev section
match/surrounding chars
view
  - sticky-mode
  - haven't used yet...




keys:
  - https://stackoverflow.com/a/7411851/225689
    - a-z vi mnemonics
      - actually really, really good!
      
  - https://michael.peopleofhonoronly.com/vim/
    - visual image / cheat-sheet

a: append
b: beginning (of current or previous word)
c: change
d: delete
e: end (of current word)
f: find (next given character on current line)
g: go (used as "leader" for many commands)
h: left (only makes sense on the keyboard used by vi's author, same for jkl)
i: insert
j: down
k: up
l: right
m: mark
n: next (occurrence of last search)
o: open (new line below current line)
p: put (paste)
q: quote? (record a macro in given register)
r: replace
s: substitute
t: toward (next given character on current line)
u: undo
v: (enter) visual mode
w: (next) word
x: x-out (delete a single character)
y: yank
z: fold (it's visual, it looks like a folded sheet of paper)


- alt mnemonics:
  - append/add
  - begin/back
  - 'til/toward
  - visual-mode/vi-mode
  - paste/put
  - quote? (to record a macro)
  - z looks like it meant to be folded
  
- changes from vi to helix:
  - **surprisingly very few changes!..:**
  - mark -> match-mode
  - substitute -> select-mode
    - no need for substitute char/line with x/select line bounds
  - x-out (delete a single char) -> select line bounds
    - originally delete char right/left..
  - z (fold) -> view-mode







windows os re-mappings (for logic, not ergonomics):
  - maybe can add an additional mapping for copy/paste to windows key
    - by default:
      - w+c - co-pilot
      - w+v - clipboard tab of a a new little input app
      - w+p - project(or) for secondary display
      - w+y - unmapped?
  - ...think of other controls

some interesting windows key mappings:
  - see all shortcuts
    - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows-dcc61a57-8ff0-cffe-9796-cb9706c75eec#windowskey
      - just skimmed through, not thorough, but i don't feel there are too many useful shortcuts..

  - w - start menu search
    - full of shit now.. use w+space instead
  - w+space - powertoys run (launcher)
  
  - w+left/right - snap window to left/right
  - w+c+left/right - next/prev workspace

  - w+tab - tabs and workspaces view
  
  - w+a - action center
  - w+t - taskbar
  - w+b - system tray
  
  - w+d - hide/show desktop
  - w+m - minimize
  - w+, - peek, hold down win key to keep peeking

  - w+v/. - clipboard/emoji picker
