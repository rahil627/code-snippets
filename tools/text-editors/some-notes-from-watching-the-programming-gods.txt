conclusion:
actually [his development method is] dead simple. nothing fancy. he has a mental model of the program--because he wrote it--somewhat recently. he has a mental model of the game, game engine, and programming language! he simply can't be bothered with dealing with stupid things like text editors, or config'ing emacs. hence, **he needs things that don't require any thinking, that's more intuitive, more physical**: a mouse, probably a touch-pad too

funny enough, he doesn't need emacs at all. He could just be using any ol' text-editor that has split panes

  - // @Tags
    - *an easily-searchable syntax for tags. or generates some docs? perhaps prints out all the tags, along with file, function, line, etc.?*
	- might be a feature in Jai..?
  - *duplicate pane*
    - very useful for long files
  - buffer jump by name (no pop-up)
  - lost of searching..
    - and replacing..--not refactoring either!
  - delete to end of line
  - *uses a mouse!*
    - i'm not the only one!
  - giant font size, but mostly because he "can't be bothered in figuring out emacs" to decrease the font-size by less than an increment
  - debug via visual studio break-point, add watches, step-through/make another break-point
    - later, he says the debug process for jai is basically the same as C/C++, just without the complexity of advanced features such as templates/inhertance
    - also provides some wisdom for debugging: *avoid using any fancy language features because it will make debugging way more difficult*
  - uses bare-grep, a simple gui app
    - really exemplifies how simple--no, *bare*--he likes things :)
  - rant against web data serialization formats: just use a binary file
  - **"it's not often that i do a single task that takes over a week"**
  - has a massive todo-list
  - actually answers a question that he surely gets often: make a game or game engine? his answer: basically, just focus on the bits of the engine you need, just enough so that you can execute the game you want to make
