# install
## windows
open the font-name-variable.wght file and click install
  - it will install all of the fonts (found in the 'static' folder) automatically

## arch-linux
for arch, just use package managers to install them
see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fonts

pacman -S adobe-source-code-pro-fonts
yay -S ttf-meslo
...

see all fonts installed by package:
pacman -Qs ttf

see names of fonts, needed to set string in config files
fc-list | fzf

the way to install without using package manager, for other distros:
/usr/share/fonts or a local dir (/.fonts/ is deprecated)



# lists of fonts
https://www.programmingfonts.org/
  - try fonts here!

fonts.google.com
  - use this site to check out contemporary pop fonts
  - although you can download them here, for linux, should use package managers
  - in order to use with crostini apps, might have to put them into the linux folders (see archwiki)

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fonts
  - also a great resource, listing some pop font packages and more resources

https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&repo=Extra&q=ttf&maintainer=&flagged=
  - ttf search of the arch package repo

https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts
  - another good pop collection

  - TODO: the one's that cost money might just be even better!!
also see powerline fonts
https://fonts.google.com/?preview.size=13&category=Monospace
  - compare fonts here


to try:
DM Mono
Ubuntu Mono
Liberation Mono

commercial fonts:
Input Mono

Dank Mono
try medium thickness for all fonts!

# settings

NOTE: the color theme of the editor effects the text's color contrast which can feel like the font-weight!

## windows, OLED laptop
vs-code
  - font-size: 11-13 (14 is default)
  - font-weight: light (300?) to regular-light (350) on OLED screen
  - consolas looks better than source code pro, but it doesn't have a lighter weight

terminal
  - mononoki
  - font-size: 10


## arch-linux, shitty chromebook
chromeos terminal
  - size 13-16
  - noto sans mono, 16
  - change font color to be slightly transparent (terminal settings -> appearance)

vs code
  - size 11-14, but has custom dpi (exec on start)
  - source code pro, 11

chrome (browser/OS?) defaults(?):
font size: 18
strandard: carlito
serif: georgia
sans: arimo
fixed-width: roboto




# current favorites:

need to find consolas in a lighter weight
or a more narrow source code pro

**consolas**
  - 12
  - a classic on Windows
  - **still looks the best on windows**, especially vs-code, where it is the default
  - damn near impossible to beat
  - small horizontal space between characters
  - 1-2 font sizes smaller than others (marketing?)
  - **comes with only one weight: regular, no light?**
  - strongly associated with vs-studio and c#

**source code pro / hasklig (light)**
  - terminal: size 10-11, weight: regular/normal
  - vscode: size 11-12, weight: light
  - best/most comfy for my eyes long-term

**hack**
  - 11, same size as source code pro
  - taller than source code pro, dejavu-like
  - only one font weight

**mononoki**
  - 12, same size as consolas
  - slightly more wider and less seriphy than consolas, and therefore more comfy, but less readable
  - a little more funky
  - only one font weight
  - using in terminal

**meslo (LG S) / NF**
  - terminal: size 10, 10.5, 11
  - also really good
  - tall like dejavu
  - wayyyy more seriphy than source code pro


trying:
monaspace neon/argon var
  - i might like this better than meslo!

monaspace krypton var
  - a little lower-resolution for terminal



progressions:
monaspace neon <- hasklig ~= source code pro
mononoki & agave

cascadia code ~= fira code <- anonymous pro (seriphy)
mesloLGS nf ~= fira mono <- dejavu sans mono
hack <- source code pro & dejavu sans mono & fira
jetbrains (sans) mono <- dejavu sans mono
  - all of these are tall'ish like dejavu



# main list:
agave
  - very simple, very cute, maybe too cute..
  - even more funky than mononoki
  - even smaller than mononoki!

cascadia mono/code
  - has a light version
  - feels more roman and seriphy than source code pro
  - but it does have better/narrower character width

monaspace
  - a collection by github
  - **neon**
    - a bigger source code pro with some more seriphy-ness
    - very good, roundy
    - good character height, not abnormally tall like dejavu-derived ones
    - i think hack is still better
  - argon
    - a less seriphy neon, feels roman
    - competes with hack, but i think hack is better
  - xenon
    - a more seriphy neon

  - radon
    - sharpie marker style!
  - krypton
    - lower-resolution/roboty, but not pixely

hack
  - meslo LG S with fewer seriphs
  - somewhere between dejavu and fira's serphiness
  - very close to consolas, similar small size font with space between lines


Meslo LG S NF
  - NF = nerd font
  - just fixes symbol positions from dejavu sans mono
  - The recommended font is the product of many individuals. Its origin is Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, which has given birth to Menlo, which in turn has spawned Meslo. Finally, extra glyphs have been added to Meslo with scripts forked from Nerd Fonts. The final font is released under the terms of Apache License.

hasklig
  - source code pro + ligatures (->, =>, etc.)
  - other weights:
    - https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/src/unpatched-fonts/Hasklig
      - somewhere in-between source code pro regular and light

mononoki
  - a cute, unique, small font
  - a more open-feeling consolas
  - the bold is great, very sans-serif
  - slightly wider and less seriphy than consolas, making it feel more comfortable
  - designed for code review, as "every character is designed to be clearly distinguishable

iosevka
  - slender: thin 'n tall, reminds me of monaco on a mac

cascadia code
  - very gamey 'n seriphy, like mononoki and fira code
    - too seriphy
  - high quality, showing surprising thickness like consolas
  - used by Microsoft for it's terminal

fira code =? jetbrains mono
  - adds space width, adds some serif-ness, probably has code-related glyphs
  - i prefer mono

JetBrains (sans) mono
  - a cute robotic version of dejavu, with long characters shortened nicely


dejavu sans mono == noto sans mono? ~= roboto mono
  - tall'ish
  - more line space on odd numbers, compare size 12 and 13
  - size 14 is nice 'n big, i dig it

PowerLine (bundle)
  - bundle of fonts from the popular PowerLevel10k zsh bundle
  - https://github.com/powerline/fonts
  - contains all of the fonts here!
  - TODO: try some of these, then uninstall this, keeping only what you need
  - source code pro for powerline uses a more bold font (medium?) and adds:
    - bad: bottom serif to 'i', lowers the '_',
    - good: otherwise does many good things like: a better 'g', bigger symbols, aligned symbols, etc.

source code pro
  - a classic
  - more sans than dejavu! very clear, roundy, 'n spacey
  - easier on the eyes as the regular weight is light
  - great in small sizes
  - squashed vertical space between lines
  - by Adobe (but i guess it's now open-source)
  - git clone --depth 1 --branch release https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro.git ~/.fonts/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro
  - fc-cache -f -v ~/.fonts/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro

Cantarell
  - used by Manjaro for ui elements

Cousine
  - squashes the f and l, i prefer it longer
  - too wide

Anonymous Pro
  - a bit serify, gothic, very round

Meslo
  - open-source customized menlo
  - AUR packages are "Meslo LG [S/M/L]" and ttf-menlo-nerd
    - nerd take 160mb :(

Menlo
  - a customized Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
  - Apple Font
    - used by Apple's dev tools 'n terminal

Inconsolata
  - open source consolas, though not as good as the original
  - maybe too scrunched up? tall? round
  - something always felt wrong about this one...

Monaco
  - and old Apple Mac OS X font, default in XCode and textmate

DejaVu Sans Mono
Andale Mono
Vera Mono

others:
hermit
  - future gui feel, but really nice! unique
lilex
  - eh.. has some seriphy robotiness to it




vintage terminal style fonts:
Dina
  - https://github.com/zshoals/Dina-Font-TTF-Remastered

proggy fonts
  - old school
