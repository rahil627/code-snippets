# windows:

helix:
  - see config for more info
**aurara**
  - my custom theme
**aura**
  - still great, can compare with my own version
default
  - great purple text, but suffers from bright yellows, and i don't like the green comments
boo berry
  - ugly christmas reds 'n greens tarnish an otherwise a very practical purple theme
**noctis**
  - sea green 'n gold underwater theme, wayyy more color-coordinated than jellyfish

classics that were well-ported:
edge (default)
  - ported by someone but not merged into helix's repo
  - like aura but with pink, likely the origin of aura, as there's an aura variation..
  - same author as everforest
tokyonight
everforest-dark


vs-code:
  - see vs-code-extensions.txt
  - https://vscodethemes.com/
    - i made it to page 7 and noted a bunch to try below
**aura**
  - the best i've seen so far..
  - dark (soft text)

decent:
noctis
  - unique color scheme, good with original green background and purple (vue) background

shades of purple
  - adventure time but purple, the dark one isn't so good tho..
  
Night Owl
  - solid, purple, blue, green
  - **italics for functions is interesting.. denoting execution goes elsewhere, like return**
  
Midnight Synth
  - not bad! purple ui, hot pink control keywords, off-purple comments, sea-green functions
  
Atom One Dark
  - solid stuff, actually same colors as aura (purple keywords, green strings; swaps orange clases with blue functions) but with a github light grey background
    - TODO: worth trying to swap functions and classes to have more blue

like palenight:
moonlight
  - ?
tokyonight
  - darkest background
catpuccin
  - variations in between
palenight
  - classic
  - purple, blue, cyan, orange, green


at least has something nice about it:
pop 'n lock
  - great contrast but bad colors. the ui is the highlight with a nice 'n clear borders 'n accents for a purp 'n gold scheme
jellyfish
  - a nice monokai variant, though incredibly bright if there's any brightness on the screen, still suffers from those ugly reds from monokai
monokai two (darker)
  - similar to github's theme, very gray in the backgrounds tho
synthwave '84
  - syntax color scheme is too wild, but i dig the sheer difference of it
  

to try next:


garbage:
Dracula Official
Firefly Pro
Cobalt2
pink-cat-boo
huacat


terminal:
wezterm

# from vim (via ipad mini?)

# my top 3
Plug 'sonph/onehalf', { 'rtp': 'vim' } “like gruvbox but with slightly lighter contrast
  - onehalflight and onehalfdark
Plug 'junegunn/seoul256.vim' “even less contrast than onehalfdark
Plug 'NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme' “more contrast than gruvbox!

Plug ‘sainnhe/everforest
Plug ‘romainl/flattened
Plug 'morhetz/gruvbox’ “#1 for a reason
