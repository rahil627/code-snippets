  - The Evolution of Web Apps 1992-2024
  - static html
    - plain old html, came first and still works great
  - server-side rendering (cgi, asp.net, ruby, etc.)
    - great, but expensive
  - "plugins" (flash, java applets, etc.)
    - iphone killed it by not allowing it, and enforcing everyone to use standard http
  - ajax -> fetch
    - an example: autocomplete
      - a json is sent upon every keystroke
  - single page apps
  - made it to 9 minutes, gettin' sleepy

	  - an architectural style of using HTTP response headers?
