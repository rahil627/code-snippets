wren for normal non-embedded scripting?

# conclusion
because there is no standard library, i dont think this can really be used for neither programs nor even small scripts. Libuv seems nice, but even that is just a minimalist io module. Even a scripting language needs a good standard library. You shouldn't have to rewrite that, nor even select them / build up your own standard library. You will need things like regex, more helpful / end-user-oriented file io and networking, and all those things you'd normal use found in a common standard library.

no is the answer

however, for it's purpose, it kicks ass, much prettier in all ways (syntax, concurrency, classes) than Lua for game 'n ui app scripting and for general embedding into C (especially embedded devices).


# what's included?
System class is bare, basically with just print(), gc(), and clock()

optional modules Meta and Random can be added via compiler flags
  - Meta includes the interpreter and compiler functions
  
Fiber class is used for concurrency
  
the rest is the standard types (strings, etc.)

these are the things that are included in the VM, and nothing more



# cli repl that includes libuv
because there is no standard library, it used libuv for concurrent io

  - test/os/process folder for process class and executing commands
  - test/io folder for file stuff
